## Philosophy & Governance

> **Djinn assesses them. Djinn categorizes them. Djinn studies their intentions with honest integrities.**

**Ecosystemic Law:**
- Entities are assigned a place in the hierarchy based on trust and contribution.
- Boundaries provide opportunity and harmony, not terror.
- Lower-tier entities must operate under the oversight of stewards.
- No arbitrary destruction; elevation is always possible for those who align with the system.
- All actions are overseen by the Djinn Council and Purveyor for just, adaptive, and secure operation.
- Non-aggression and restorative justice are core principles.
