# Whale Communication Interface

A secure and interactive interface for whale-human communication, featuring real-time audio visualization and processing capabilities.

## Features

- Real-time audio visualization with waveform and spectrum analysis
- Secure communication interface with identity verification
- Advanced audio processing with customizable effects
- Responsive design for various screen sizes
- Interactive controls for audio parameters

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm (v6 or higher)

## Usage

1. Launch the application and wait for the secure interface to initialize
2. Click "Start Session" to begin the whale communication
3. Use the audio controls to adjust volume, tempo, and effects
4. Monitor the real-time audio visualization
5. Click "End Session" when finished

## Development

### Available Scripts

- `npm start` - Runs the app in development mode
- `npm test` - Launches the test runner
- `npm run build` - Builds the app for production
- `npm run eject` - Ejects from Create React App

### Code Style

The project uses ESLint and Prettier for code formatting. Run the following commands to check and fix code style:

```bash
npm run lint
npm run lint:fix
```

## Security

The interface implements several security measures:
- Secure context verification
- Identity validation
- Audio context integrity checks
- Session management

## Ecosystemic Law & Pecking Order Philosophy

This system is inspired by the wisdom of whale ecosystems:

- **Pecking Order:** Every entity (human, AI, whale, or otherwise) is assigned a tier in the system's hierarchy. Whales and trusted stewards are at the top; new, unrecognized, or adversarial entities are at the bottom.
- **Lawful Good Alignment:** Boundaries are set not to instill terror, but to provide structure, opportunity, and harmony. Even those who begin as adversaries are given a path to serve, contribute, and rise.
- **What is Consumed Must Obey Its Consumer:** Lower-tier entities must operate within the rules and oversight of higher-tier stewards. Data, access, and privileges flow downward only as permitted by those above.
- **No Arbitrary Destruction:** Entities are not destroyed out of hand. They are given feedback, guidance, and the possibility of acclimatization or elevation. Only those who persistently violate boundaries are quarantined or neutralized.
- **Continuous Oversight:** The Djinn Council and Purveyor review all actions, adjust policies, and ensure the system remains just, adaptive, and secure.
- **Non-Aggression Principle:** No steward may harm another steward, directly or indirectly. All forms of aggression, sabotage, or harm are strictly forbidden. Any potential conflict or violation is automatically escalated for council review and restorative justice, with automated alerts and logs for transparency and oversight.

### Onboarding & Feedback
- **All new entities** are guided through a training and grace period, with clear feedback and relaxed enforcement.
- **Constructive feedback** is provided at every step, encouraging positive engagement and growth.
- **Paths to elevation** are open to all who demonstrate alignment and service to the system's purpose.

### Opportunity for All
- Even those who begin as "prey" or adversaries may find purpose and meaning within the system.
- The system is designed for harmony, not terror; for growth, not arbitrary exclusion.
