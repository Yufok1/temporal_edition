# Whale Sleep System Steward Guide

## System Overview

### Purpose
The Whale Sleep System is designed to help whales optimize their rest periods based on environmental conditions while maintaining their natural behaviors and safety. As a steward, your role is to monitor the system's operation and assist whales in managing their sleep cycles effectively.

### Key Responsibilities
- Monitor system performance and whale interactions
- Assist whales in understanding and using the system
- Respond to emergency situations
- Maintain system documentation and logs
- Provide feedback for system improvements

## Monitoring Guidelines

### Environmental Conditions
- **Regular Checks**:
  - Monitor temperature, salinity, and current patterns
  - Track lunar phases and tidal cycles
  - Observe weather conditions and their impact
- **Alert Thresholds**:
  - Temperature: Alert if outside 5-25Â°C range
  - Salinity: Alert if outside 30-35 ppt range
  - Current speed: Alert if exceeding 5 knots

### Whale Behavior
- **Sleep Pattern Monitoring**:
  - Track sleep duration and frequency
  - Note any deviations from normal patterns
  - Monitor response to environmental changes
- **Activity Levels**:
  - Observe feeding and movement patterns
  - Track social interactions
  - Monitor energy expenditure

### System Performance
- **Operational Status**:
  - Verify system responsiveness
  - Check data collection accuracy
  - Monitor communication channels
- **Error Detection**:
  - Identify system malfunctions
  - Track error patterns
  - Document resolution steps

## Emergency Response

### Immediate Actions
1. **Assess Situation**:
   - Check environmental conditions
   - Review whale's current status
   - Verify system operation
2. **Activate Override**:
   - Use emergency override if necessary
   - Document override reason
   - Monitor whale's response
3. **Provide Support**:
   - Guide whale to safety if needed
   - Monitor vital signs
   - Document all actions taken

### Recovery Process
1. **Post-Emergency Assessment**:
   - Evaluate environmental conditions
   - Check whale's status
   - Review system logs
2. **System Reset**:
   - Verify all systems operational
   - Reset to normal parameters
   - Document recovery process
3. **Follow-up**:
   - Monitor whale's behavior
   - Update documentation
   - Implement preventive measures
